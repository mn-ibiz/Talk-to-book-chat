Multi-Agent System for Talk2Publish

This module implements a LangGraph-based multi-agent system where each specialist
(Biographer, Empath, Title Generator, Planner, Writer) is a graph node that can
communicate directly with the user and transition smoothly between agents.

Key improvements over task-tool architecture:
- Each agent is a graph node (not a subagent)
- Direct agent-to-user communication (no relaying)
- State-based agent tracking (not pattern matching)
- Smooth transitions with full context retention
- Real-time transition events for UI updates
