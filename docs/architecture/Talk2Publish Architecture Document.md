# **Talk2Publish Architecture Document**

### **Introduction**

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Talk2Publish API, a Python-based backend service designed to power a conversational book-writing platform. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to the chosen patterns and technologies as defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

This is a backend-only service, and as such, all frontend and UI/UX concerns are assumed to be handled by the parent SaaS application that will consume this API.

#### **Starter Template or Existing Project**

The project will be built as a greenfield Python application using the **`deepagents` Python package** as the foundational framework. This package provides the core orchestration logic, state management, virtual file system for session artifacts, and built-in middleware for planning, filesystem operations, sub-agent management, message summarization, and human-in-the-loop interactions.

### **High Level Architecture**

#### **Technical Summary**

The Talk2Publish API is designed as a monolithic Python service deployed on Railway, with a highly modular, agent-based internal architecture. It leverages the LangGraph framework to orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents that guide users through the book-writing process. All persistent data, including user-generated content and agent prompts, will be stored in a Neon PostgreSQL database. The entire system is housed within a monorepo to facilitate seamless integration with the parent SaaS application.

#### **High Level Overview**

As specified in the PRD, the system follows a **Monolithic Service** approach. The Python application will be a single deployable unit, which simplifies infrastructure management for the MVP. Internally, the application will be composed of a network of AI agents managed by a central **Orchestration Agent**, following the "Deep Agent" pattern. The repository will be structured as a **Monorepo**, allowing the parent SaaS and this API to coexist, sharing code and configurations where necessary. The primary user interaction flows through a conversational chat interface, with the API handling all state management, data persistence, and AI-driven content generation.

#### **Architectural and Design Patterns**

* **Deep Agent Pattern:** Built using the `create_deep_agent()` function from the deepagents package, which provides orchestration, planning tools, virtual filesystem, and sub-agent management out of the box.
* **Repository Pattern:** A data access layer will be implemented to abstract the database logic. This decouples the agent business logic from the Neon database, making the code cleaner, easier to test, and more maintainable.
* **Stateful Agent Workflow:** The entire conversational flow will be managed as a persistent, stateful graph using LangGraph with a checkpointer. The `DeepAgentState` schema includes messages, todos, and files with proper reducers for state merging.
* **Virtual File System:** Session artifacts are managed in-memory using the deepagents virtual filesystem (stored in state as `dict[str, str]`). Files are passed via the `files` key in state and retrieved from results. This provides a fast, isolated workspace for each user interaction.
* **Middleware Stack:** The deepagents framework automatically applies five middleware layers: PlanningMiddleware (todos), FilesystemMiddleware (file operations), SubAgentMiddleware (agent delegation), SummarizationMiddleware (context management), and HITL Middleware (human interrupts).

### **Tech Stack**

#### **Cloud Infrastructure**

* **Provider:** Railway  
* **Key Services:** App Hosting, Neon PostgreSQL Database  
* **Deployment Regions:** TBD (To be determined based on user geography)

### **Deep Agent Implementation Details**

#### **Core Agent Creation**

The Talk2Publish system will be built using the `create_deep_agent()` function from the deepagents package:

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

# Define sub-agents
biographer = {
    "name": "biographer",
    "description": "Captures author profile and writing style",
    "prompt": "You are an expert biographer...",
    "tools": []  # Inherits main agent tools by default
}

# Create orchestration agent
orchestrator = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[custom_tool_1, custom_tool_2],
    instructions="You are the Talk2Publish orchestration agent...",
    subagents=[biographer, empath, planner, writer],
    tool_configs={
        "gap_analysis_tool": True  # Enable HITL for this tool
    }
)

# Attach checkpointer for state persistence
orchestrator.checkpointer = MemorySaver()
```

#### **Built-in Middleware Stack**

The deepagents framework automatically applies the following middleware (in order):

1. **PlanningMiddleware**: Provides `write_todos` tool for task management
2. **FilesystemMiddleware**: Provides `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` tools for virtual filesystem
3. **SubAgentMiddleware**: Provides `task` tool for spawning sub-agents with isolated contexts
4. **SummarizationMiddleware**: Automatically summarizes conversation history when context exceeds 120K tokens (keeps last 20 messages)
5. **AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware**: Caches system prompts for 5 minutes to reduce API costs
6. **HumanInTheLoopMiddleware** (if `tool_configs` provided): Pauses execution at configured tools for human approval

#### **State Schema**

The agent uses `DeepAgentState` which extends LangGraph's `AgentState`:

```python
class DeepAgentState(AgentState):
    todos: NotRequired[list[Todo]]
    files: Annotated[NotRequired[dict[str, str]], file_reducer]
```

- **todos**: List of task items with status (pending, in_progress, completed)
- **files**: Virtual filesystem as key-value pairs (filename → content)
- **messages**: Standard LangGraph message history
- **file_reducer**: Custom reducer that merges file dictionaries across turns

#### **Virtual Filesystem Usage**

Files are managed entirely in-state during a session:

```python
# Invoke with initial files
result = orchestrator.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Start profiling"}],
    "files": {"author_notes.txt": "Initial thoughts..."}
}, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "user_123_project_456"}})

# Access updated files
session_files = result["files"]
author_profile = session_files.get("author_profile.json")

# Persist to database when phase complete
with get_session() as session:
    profile_repo = AuthorProfileRepository(session)
    profile_repo.create({
        "book_project_id": project_id,
        "profile_data": json.loads(author_profile)
    })
    session.commit()
```

#### **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Flow**

Tools requiring approval are configured via `tool_configs`:

```python
# Configure HITL interrupts
orchestrator = create_deep_agent(
    tools=[gap_analysis_tool],
    instructions="...",
    tool_configs={
        "gap_analysis_tool": {
            "allow_accept": True,
            "allow_respond": True,
            "allow_edit": True
        }
    },
    checkpointer=MemorySaver()  # Required for HITL
)

# Stream execution - will pause at gap_analysis_tool
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "conversation_1"}}
for chunk in orchestrator.stream({"messages": [...]}, config):
    print(chunk)
    # Detects interrupt, shows tool call to user

# Resume with approval
orchestrator.stream(Command(resume=[{"type": "accept"}]), config)

# Or resume with feedback (tool doesn't execute)
orchestrator.stream(Command(resume=[{
    "type": "response",
    "args": "Please focus on these topics instead..."
}]), config)
```

#### **Sub-Agent Configuration**

Sub-agents can be simple dictionaries or custom LangGraph graphs:

```python
# Simple sub-agent (uses deepagents structure)
biographer = {
    "name": "biographer",
    "description": "Captures author profile",
    "prompt": "You are an expert biographer...",
    "tools": [custom_tool],  # Optional: subset of tools
    "model": {  # Optional: per-agent model override
        "model": "anthropic:claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
        "temperature": 0
    }
}

# Custom sub-agent (pre-built graph)
from langchain.agents import create_agent

custom_graph = create_agent(
    model=your_model,
    tools=[specialized_tool],
    prompt="You are a specialized agent..."
)

custom_subagent = {
    "name": "data-analyzer",
    "description": "Specialized data analysis",
    "graph": custom_graph
}

# Both can be used together
orchestrator = create_deep_agent(
    tools=main_tools,
    instructions="...",
    subagents=[biographer, custom_subagent]
)
```

#### **Built-in Tools**

Every deep agent automatically gets these tools:

- `write_todos`: Task planning and progress tracking
- `ls`: List files in virtual filesystem
- `read_file`: Read file content with offset/limit support
- `write_file`: Create new files in virtual filesystem
- `edit_file`: Perform exact string replacements in files
- `task`: Spawn sub-agents for isolated tasks (general-purpose + custom sub-agents)

### **Components**

#### **API Interface**

**Responsibility:** To serve as the public-facing entry point for the parent SaaS application. It handles incoming HTTP requests, validates payloads, manages the request/response lifecycle, and forwards requests to the Orchestration Agent.

**Key Interfaces:**

* POST /chat: Main endpoint for all conversational interactions.

**Dependencies:** Orchestration Agent.

**Technology Stack:** FastAPI, Python.

#### **Orchestration Agent**

**Responsibility:** The central brain of the application. It manages the entire book-writing workflow as a stateful graph, sequences the sub-agents, maintains session state, and ensures the user is guided logically through the process. It is the sole component that interacts directly with the Sub-Agents.

**Key Interfaces:**

* execute\_workflow(user\_input, current\_state): Processes user input and advances the workflow.

**Dependencies:** All Sub-Agents, Data Access Layer.

**Technology Stack:** LangGraph, Python.

#### **Sub-Agents (Biographer, Empath, Planner, Writer)**

**Responsibility:** A collection of specialized, single-purpose agents. Each is an expert in one area of the workflow (e.g., the Biographer only handles author profiling). They execute their specific task and return the result to the Orchestrator.

**Key Interfaces:**

* A common run(state) method that executes their defined task.

**Dependencies:** Data Access Layer (to persist results), Orchestration Agent.

**Technology Stack:** LangGraph, Python.

#### **Data Access Layer (DAL)**

**Responsibility:** To implement the Repository Pattern, abstracting all database operations. This is the only component that communicates directly with the Neon database. It provides a clean, business-oriented API for the agents to read and write data without needing to know SQL.

**Key Interfaces:**

* get\_book\_project(id), save\_chapter(data), get\_active\_prompt(agent\_name), etc.

**Dependencies:** Neon PostgreSQL Database.

**Technology Stack:** SQLAlchemy, psycopg2, Python.

### **Infrastructure and Deployment**

This section defines the CI/CD pipeline, environment strategy, and rollback procedures. The approach is designed for simplicity and automation, leveraging the tight integration between GitHub and Railway.

#### **Infrastructure as Code**

* **Tool:** N/A for MVP. The infrastructure (app service, database) will be provisioned manually via the Railway UI.  
* **Location:** N/A  
* **Approach:** For the MVP, we will rely on Railway's managed infrastructure. More complex infrastructure needs in the future could be managed with a tool like Terraform, but that is out of scope for now.

#### **Deployment Strategy**

* **Strategy:** Continuous Deployment. Every merge to the main branch will automatically trigger a deployment to the production environment on Railway.  
* **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions.  
* **Pipeline Configuration:** The workflow will be defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yml. It will consist of two main steps:  
  1. **Test:** Run the full pytest suite. The deployment will only proceed if all tests pass.  
  2. **Deploy:** Use the official Railway Action to deploy the application.

#### **Environments**

* **Development:** Local developer machines, a local or Railway-hosted development database.  
* **Production:** A single production environment hosted on Railway. For the MVP, we will not maintain a separate staging environment to keep the process lean.

#### **Environment Promotion Flow**

\[Local Dev\] \---\> \[Push to GitHub Feature Branch\] \---\> \[Merge PR to Main\] \---\> \[GitHub Actions: Test\] \---\> \[GitHub Actions: Deploy to Railway Prod\]

#### **Rollback Strategy**

* **Primary Method:** Fast Re-deploy via GitHub. If a bug is found in production, the primary rollback method is to revert the problematic commit in the main branch and let the CI/CD pipeline automatically re-deploy the previous stable version.  
* **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bug affecting core functionality, API downtime, or a significant increase in the error rate post-deployment.  
* **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Less than 15 minutes. The automated pipeline should be able to deploy a reverted commit quickly.

### **Error Handling Strategy**

This section defines the application-wide strategy for handling errors, logging, and ensuring system stability. A consistent approach is mandatory for both AI and human developers.

#### **General Approach**

* **Error Model:** The system will use a centralized exception handling model. FastAPI's exception handlers will be used to catch all unhandled exceptions at the API boundary, ensuring that no raw stack traces are ever sent to the client.  
* **Exception Hierarchy:** We will define a custom exception hierarchy (e.g., AgentError, DatabaseError, ValidationError) that inherits from a base Talk2PublishError. This allows for granular error handling while providing a common structure.  
* **Error Propagation:** Errors originating in lower layers (e.g., the DAL) will be caught and re-raised as more specific exceptions (e.g., a generic SQLError becomes a DuplicateChapterError). The Orchestrator will be responsible for the final interpretation of these errors, deciding whether to retry, ask the user for clarification, or halt the workflow.

#### **Logging Standards**

* **Library:** Python's built-in logging module will be configured for structured logging (JSON format).  
* **Format:** Logs will be in JSON format, containing a timestamp, log level, message, and a context object with relevant metadata (e.g., user\_id, book\_project\_id, current\_stage).  
* **Levels:**  
  * INFO: For key workflow transitions (e.g., "Starting Audience Definition agent").  
  * WARNING: For recoverable issues (e.g., "Transcript analysis found 3 new topics").  
  * ERROR: For unrecoverable errors that halt a workflow (e.g., "Database connection failed").  
  * DEBUG: For detailed diagnostic information during development.  
* **Required Context:** Every log entry must include a book\_project\_id and user\_id where available to allow for tracing a single user's session through the system.

#### **Error Handling Patterns**

* **Business Logic Errors:** The Orchestrator and Sub-Agents will handle expected business logic failures (e.g., user provides invalid input) gracefully. These will result in a clear, user-friendly message being sent back through the API, not a generic 500 error. A custom UserFacingError exception will be used for this purpose.  
* **Data Consistency:** The Data Access Layer will leverage database transactions (session.commit(), session.rollback()) for all write operations that involve multiple tables to ensure data integrity.  
* **External API Errors:** Since there are no external API calls in the MVP, this is not applicable. This section will be expanded in Phase II.

### **Coding Standards**

These standards are mandatory for all developers, including AI agents, to ensure the codebase is clean, consistent, and maintainable.

#### **Core Standards**

* **Languages & Runtimes:** All code must conform to **Python 3.11+**.  
* **Style & Linting:** Code will be formatted using black with its default settings. Linting will be enforced using flake8. These checks will be run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Test Organization:** Test files must be located in the tests/ directory and mirror the structure of the src/ directory. File names must be prefixed with test\_.

#### **Naming Conventions**

| Element | Convention | Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Files/Modules** | snake\_case | biographer.py |
| **Classes** | PascalCase | OrchestrationAgent |
| **Functions/Methods** | snake\_case | execute\_workflow |
| **Variables** | snake\_case | book\_project\_id |
| **Constants** | UPPER\_SNAKE\_CASE | MAX\_RETRIES |

#### **Critical Rules**

* **Database Access:** All database interactions **MUST** go through the Data Access Layer (Repository Pattern). Direct use of SQLAlchemy sessions or queries outside of the database/repository.py module is strictly forbidden.  
* **Configuration:** All configuration and environment variables **MUST** be accessed via the central core/config.py module. Never use os.getenv() directly in agent or business logic.  
* **Error Handling:** All custom exceptions **MUST** inherit from the base Talk2PublishError. Never let raw exceptions from libraries (e.g., SQLAlchemyError) propagate to the API layer.  
* **Logging:** All logging **MUST** use the configured structured logger. Never use print() statements for debugging or informational output in the application code.

### **Test Strategy and Standards**

This section outlines the testing approach, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the agent-based system and validating the quality of the AI-generated content.

#### **Testing Philosophy**

* **Approach:** The project will follow a "Test-After" approach, consistent with the PRD's "Unit \+ Integration" requirement. AI agents will generate functional code first, followed by a comprehensive suite of tests to validate correctness.  
* **Coverage Goals:** A target of **85% code coverage** will be enforced for all new code. This will be automatically checked in the CI/CD pipeline.  
* **Test Pyramid:** We will adhere to a standard test pyramid, with a large base of fast unit tests, a smaller number of integration tests for component interactions, and a minimal set of E2E tests for critical user flows.

#### **Test Types and Organization**

* **Unit Tests:**  
  * **Framework:** Pytest  
  * **File Convention:** test\_\*.py located in the tests/ directory, mirroring the src/ structure.  
  * **Scope:** Test individual functions and class methods in isolation. All external dependencies (database, other agents) **MUST** be mocked using unittest.mock.  
  * **AI Agent Requirements:** AI agents must generate unit tests for all public methods in the services and agents they create, covering both happy paths and error conditions.  
* **Integration Tests:**  
  * **Scope:** These tests will validate the interactions between components, primarily focusing on:  
    1. The flow from the API Interface, through the Orchestrator, to a Sub-Agent.  
    2. The interaction between the Data Access Layer and a real database instance.  
  * **Location:** tests/integration/  
  * **Test Infrastructure:** To ensure isolated and reproducible tests, we will use **Testcontainers**. This will programmatically spin up a temporary PostgreSQL container for each integration test run, ensuring a clean database state.  
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  
  * **Scope:** For this backend-only MVP, E2E tests are out of scope. They will be the responsibility of the parent SaaS application that consumes this API.

#### **Test Data Management**

* **Strategy:** Test data will be managed using Pytest **fixtures**.  
* **Fixtures:** Reusable test data and setup/teardown logic will be defined in tests/conftest.py.  
* **Factories:** For generating complex model instances, we will use the factory-boy library to create test data factories.

#### **Continuous Testing**

* **CI Integration:** The GitHub Actions workflow defined in .github/workflows/test.yml will automatically run the entire pytest suite (both unit and integration tests) on every push to any branch. Pull requests will be blocked from merging if any tests fail.

### **Security**

This section defines the mandatory security requirements to protect the application, its data, and its users. These rules apply to all code generated by AI agents.

#### **Input Validation**

* **Validation Library:** Pydantic models will be used within FastAPI for all incoming request validation.  
* **Validation Location:** Validation will be enforced at the API boundary (within the routes/ layer). No unvalidated data should ever reach the agent or service layers.  
* **Required Rules:**  
  * All external inputs from the parent SaaS **MUST** be validated against a strict Pydantic model.  
  * Use specific data types (e.g., EmailStr for emails) where available.  
  * Whitelist acceptable values for fields where possible (e.g., for current\_stage).

#### **Authentication & Authorization**

* **Auth Method:** The API will be protected using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. The parent SaaS is expected to provide a valid JWT in the Authorization header of every request.  
* **Implementation:** A FastAPI dependency will be created to validate the JWT signature and expiration and to extract the user\_id from the token's claims.  
* **Required Patterns:**  
  * Every API endpoint (except a public health check) **MUST** be protected by this authentication dependency.  
  * The user\_id extracted from the token **MUST** be used in all database queries to ensure users can only access their own data.

#### **Secrets Management**

* **Development:** Secrets (e.g., database URL, JWT secret key) will be managed in a local .env file, which is excluded from source control by .gitignore.  
* **Production:** Secrets will be managed securely using **Railway's built-in environment variable management system**.  
* **Code Requirements:**  
  * **NEVER** hardcode secrets in the source code.  
  * Access secrets **ONLY** through the core/config.py module.  
  * **NEVER** log secrets or any personally identifiable information (PII).

#### **API Security**

* **Rate Limiting:** A rate limiter (e.g., slowapi) will be implemented as FastAPI middleware to protect against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.  
* **CORS Policy:** A Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be configured to only allow requests from the domain of the parent SaaS application.  
* **HTTPS Enforcement:** Railway automatically handles TLS termination, ensuring all traffic is served over HTTPS. No application-level configuration is required.

#### **Data Protection**

* **Encryption at Rest:** Handled automatically by Neon PostgreSQL.  
* **Encryption in Transit:** Handled automatically by Railway's load balancers (HTTPS).  
* **PII Handling:** User-generated book content is considered sensitive. Access is strictly controlled by the user\_id authorization check on every request.

#### **Dependency Security**

* **Scanning Tool:** The CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions will include a step to run pip-audit to scan for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.  
* **Update Policy:** The build will fail if any critical vulnerabilities are found.  
* **Approval Process:** Adding new dependencies requires a pull request and review to assess the security and maintenance implications.

### **Checklist Results Report**

#### **Architect Solution Validation Summary**

* **Overall Architecture Readiness:** High. The architecture is comprehensive, well-defined, and directly aligned with all functional and non-functional requirements from the PRD.  
* **Project Type:** Backend Service. Frontend and UI-specific sections of the checklist were skipped.  
* **Critical Risks:** Low. The primary risks are related to the successful implementation of the LangGraph "Deep Agent" pattern, which is a known complexity.  
* **Key Strengths:** Clear separation of concerns, robust testing and security strategies, and a well-defined, automated deployment pipeline.
