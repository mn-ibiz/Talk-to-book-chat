# **Story 1.1: Project Foundation & Orchestrator Setup**

### **Status**

Ready for Review

### **Story**

As a Developer,  
I want a foundational project structure set up with the core Orchestration Agent,  
so that I have a stable, testable starting point for building the agent workflow.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The project repository is initialized on GitHub according to the Monorepo structure.  
2. A basic Python project is created, including dependency management and configuration files.  
3. LangGraph, the Neon DB connector, and other core dependencies are installed.  
4. A "health check" API endpoint is created and successfully deployed to Railway to validate the CI/CD pipeline.  
5. The foundational Orchestration Agent is implemented, capable of starting the workflow, maintaining state, and transitioning between at least two placeholder sub-agents.  
6. The test suite (Unit \+ Integration) is set up, with a basic passing test for the Orchestrator's initial state.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[x\] **Task 1: Initialize Project Structure** (AC: 1\)
  * \[x\] Create the root talk2publish-monorepo/ directory.
  * \[x\] Create the apps/api/ directory for our Python service.
  * \[x\] Create the .github/workflows/ directory.
  * \[x\] Create docs/ and add the existing prd.md and architecture.md.
  * \[x\] Create a root .gitignore file.
* \[x\] **Task 2: Set up Python Environment** (AC: 2, 3\)
  * \[x\] Inside apps/api/, create a requirements.txt file.
  * \[x\] Add the following core dependencies to requirements.txt:
    * fastapi
    * uvicorn
    * langgraph
    * psycopg2-binary
    * sqlalchemy
    * pytest
    * requests (for testing the endpoint)
  * \[x\] Create a basic src/ directory structure inside apps/api/.
* \[x\] **Task 3: Implement Basic FastAPI Application** (AC: 4\)
  * \[x\] In apps/api/src/main.py, create a basic FastAPI application instance.
  * \[x\] Implement a GET /health endpoint that returns {"status": "ok"}.
* \[x\] **Task 4: Create CI/CD Pipeline** (AC: 4\)
  * \[x\] Create .github/workflows/test.yml to run pytest on every push.
  * \[x\] Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml to deploy the apps/api service to Railway on every push to the main branch.
* \[x\] **Task 5: Scaffold Orchestration Agent** (AC: 5\)
  * \[x\] In apps/api/src/agents/, create a new file orchestrator.py.
  * \[x\] Implement a placeholder OrchestrationAgent class.
  * \[x\] Using LangGraph, define a state graph with at least three nodes: start, placeholder\_agent\_1, and end. The graph should transition from start to placeholder\_agent\_1 and then to end.
* \[x\] **Task 6: Set up Initial Test Suite** (AC: 6\)
  * \[x\] Create the apps/api/tests/ directory.
  * \[x\] In apps/api/tests/test\_routes.py, create a test that calls the /health endpoint and asserts a 200 OK response.
  * \[x\] In apps/api/tests/test\_agents.py, create a basic unit test for the OrchestrationAgent that verifies its initial state.

### **Dev Notes**

This section contains all relevant technical context extracted from the architecture document required to complete this story.

Project Structure:  
The developer must create the following directory structure.

│   └── workflows/  
│       ├── test.yml

Technology Stack:  
Use the following technologies and versions as specified.  
Source: docs/architecture.md\#Technology Stack Table

* **Language:** Python 3.11+  
* **Web Framework:** FastAPI  
* **Agent Framework:** LangGraph  
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions  
* **Testing:** Pytest

Deployment Pipeline:  
The GitHub Actions workflow for deployment should use the official Railway Action and be triggered on a push to the main branch. It must be preceded by a test step that runs the full pytest suite.  
Source: docs/architecture.md\#Deployment Strategy  
Testing Standards:  
All test files must be located in the tests/ directory and be prefixed with test\_. The test.yml GitHub Actions workflow must execute the pytest command to run all discovered tests.
