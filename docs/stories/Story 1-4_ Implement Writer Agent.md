# **Story 1-4: Implement Writer Agent**

### **Status**

Ready for Review

### **Story**

As a System,  
I need a specialized "Writer" agent that can synthesize a plan, transcript, and clarifications into a first draft,  
so that the Orchestrator can delegate the final writing task.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. A "Writer" sub-agent is implemented.  
2. The agent can accept a full context object (plan, transcript, HITL answers) as input.  
3. The agent generates a coherent, well-structured chapter draft in Markdown format.  
4. The generated draft meets the quality standard of requiring only stylistic edits.  
5. The agent saves the final draft to the appropriate Chapter record in the database.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[x\] **Task 1: Create Writer Agent** (AC: 1, 2, 3\)
  * \[x\] In apps/api/src/agents/, create a new file writer.py.
  * \[x\] Implement writer_config dictionary for deepagents framework.
  * \[x\] Develop comprehensive prompt for synthesizing inputs and generating chapter drafts.
* \[x\] **Task 2: Implement Database Interaction** (AC: 5\)
  * \[x\] In apps/api/src/database/repository.py, add update\_draft method to ChapterRepository.
* \[x\] **Task 3: Add Unit Tests** (AC: 4, 5\)
  * \[x\] In apps/api/tests/test\_agents.py, add unit tests for writer_config.
  * \[x\] Test configuration structure and required fields.

### **Dev Notes**

File Structure:  
Create the agent file at apps/api/src/agents/writer.py. Modify the existing repository at apps/api/src/database/repository.py.  
Source: docs/architecture.md\#Source Tree  
Data Model:  
The agent must update the draft\_content and status fields of a specific Chapter record.  
Source: docs/architecture.md\#Data Models  
Repository Pattern:  
All database operations MUST go through the Data Access Layer.  
Source: docs/architecture.md\#Coding Standards  
Quality Standard:  
The prompt for this agent is critical. It must be engineered to produce a high-quality, coherent narrative that requires minimal structural editing.
